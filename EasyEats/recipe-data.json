If you donât have a wire mesh sieve, place the quinoa in a bowl, fill it with cool water and swish the quinoa around. Allow it to settle and then carefully pour out the water. Repeat 4-5 times. Rinsing quinoa well is essential to remove its natural coating, which can cause the quinoa to taste bitter.",

As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and allow it to rest, without removing the lid, for ten minutes.",

                    "Add all of the bok choy to the skillet along with 1/2 tsp of salt (this will help it wilt). Stir and saute until the bok choy has wilted and the thick pieces of stalk have become slightly transparent (about 5 minutes). Remove from the heat, adjust salt as needed, drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds."
